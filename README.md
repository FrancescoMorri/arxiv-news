# arxiv-news
Quick and simple website to solve a problem I had, which was looking through new papers in multiple categories at once on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

[Here](https://arxiv-multicatchup.streamlit.app/) you just need to select the categories from the possible options (or add whatever you want in the arXiv format) and you can browse the latest papers of all the categories together, order by date (newest first).
